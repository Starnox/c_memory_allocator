# Operating Systems
### Student: Mihailescu Eduard-Florin 322CB

## Overview
This code is meant to solve the second challenge given by the Operating Systems team
as part of the curriculum studying at Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers 
in Bucharest. 
As part of the challenge, I implemented a minimalistic implementation of dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` and `free`) using a block data structure called `block_meta`. All the logic that works directly with blocks is located in `helpers.c` while the gist of the implementation is in `osmem.c`, with some small helper functions in `pointerhelpers.h`. 

## Reflection
It was a fun assignment, thogh I spent more time that I would have liked on debugging it. I think I needed to spend more time thinking before implementing, while Github Copilot also introduced a lot of bugs, and it was much better deactivating it.
